# Automated Critical Path Scheduling Through Virtual Reality Project Planning

This repo contains the code for our study investigating the automated generation of critical path schedules following a user's engagement with a VR planning simulation.

Following the formulation of the proposed methodology, two case studies based on key use cases are presented.

## Example 1

The first case study is based on a straightforward task wherein an operator must cut a machine into pieces in place and efficiently pack the pieces in a waste container. The task depicted in the first case study takes around a dozen activities (moving, cutting, etc) over a few minutes to complete.

## Example 2

In the second study, a much larger process in a nuclear decommissioning context is depicted. The VR operator must take apart a large portion of a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) based on the Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) design. The size and scope of the project illuminates the methodology in a more complex environment, with activities for creating temporary bracing and access required. In both case studies, the generated schedules are closely verified against the VR operators actions to validate the methodology.
